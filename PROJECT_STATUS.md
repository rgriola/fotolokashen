## Architecture Notes

### Email System

- **Templates**: Styled HTML with responsive design
- **Development Mode**: Console logging only
- **Production Mode**: Resend API
- **Customization**: Admin preview tool for testing
- **Timezone Handling**: User timezone preference or UTC fallback

### Photo Storage

- Flat directory structure (no subdirectories by date)
- Path format: `/{environment}/users/{userId}/photos/{filename}`
- Files stored on ImageKit CDN
- Database stores metadata (locationId, placeId, imagekitFileId, etc.)
- EXIF data extraction for GPS coordinates

### User-Specific Locations

- Each user has their own saved locations (UserSave)
- Same Google Place can be saved by multiple users with different metadata
- UserSave contains: personalRating, caption, isFavorite, locationId, userId
- Location contains: Google Place data (name, address, coordinates, etc.)

### Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: Custom JWT with secure token generation
- **Rate Limiting**: Multiple time windows (15 min, 1 hour)
- **Security Logging**: All events tracked in database
- **Session Management**: Token-based with expiration
- **Email Verification**: Required, cannot be bypassed

### Type System

- **UserSave**: User's personal save with metadata
- **Location**: Actual location data from Google Places
- **LocationData**: Client-side location representation
- **MarkerData**: Map marker visualization data
- **PublicUser**: Sanitized user data for client
