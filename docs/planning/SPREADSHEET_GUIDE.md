## 🎯 Talking Points for Investors

### Point 1: "We're Taking a De-Risked Approach"
*"We're starting with a $4,500 PWA to validate demand in 1 month. Only if we hit 50+ weekly active users will we invest $30k in native iOS. This phases our $34.5k investment with clear go/no-go milestones."*

**Supporting Data**: Section 15 (Phased Approach)

---

### Point 2: "PWA Breakeven is 3 Months"
*"Our PWA investment of $4,500 breaks even in just 3 months, compared to 18 months for native iOS. This minimizes cash burn during product-market fit validation."*

**Supporting Data**: Section 12 (Breakeven Analysis)

---

### Point 3: "Native iOS Has Proven Economics"
*"If PWA validates demand, native iOS shows 140% ROI over 36 months with 18-month breakeven. This is industry-standard for mobile apps."*

**Supporting Data**: Section 7 (ROI Analysis)

---

### Point 4: "Infrastructure Costs Are Negligible"
*"Our operational costs are $0-50/month using free tiers of Neon, Vercel, ImageKit, and Google Maps. This stays true through 100+ daily active users."*

**Supporting Data**: Section 8 (Monthly Operational Costs)

---

### Point 5: "We Can Pivot Quickly"
*"PWA works on iOS and Android simultaneously. If user feedback requires major changes, we pivot in weeks, not months, before committing to native."*

**Supporting Data**: Section 6 (Feature Comparison)

---

## 📋 Decision Framework (From Spreadsheet)

### If Your Budget Is:

**$0 - $5,000**: 
- Choose: **Scenario D (PWA MVP)**
- Rationale: Validate market, works everywhere, fast pivot
- Timeline: 4 weeks
- Risk: Medium (PWA limitations)

**$5,000 - $15,000**:
- Choose: **Scenario B (Hybrid)**
- Rationale: Best value, you handle backend, professional iOS
- Timeline: 10 weeks
- Risk: Low (professional developer)

**$15,000 - $40,000**:
- Choose: **Full Professional**
- Rationale: Complete native solution, hands-off
- Timeline: 10 weeks
- Risk: Medium (scope management)

**$40,000+**:
- Choose: **Scenario C (Agency)**
- Rationale: Professional design, QA, complete package
- Timeline: 8 weeks
- Risk: Very Low (locked scope, proven team)
