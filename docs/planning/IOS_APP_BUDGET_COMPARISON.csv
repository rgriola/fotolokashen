KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR INVESTORS
Finding,Value,Impact
Backend represents 25% of mobile app cost,"$5k - $10k",Often underestimated in budget planning
Infrastructure costs are minimal in development,$0 - $50/month,Free tiers cover staging completely
PWA approach reduces initial investment by 85%,"$4.5k vs $30k",Allows rapid market validation
Senior developers are net cheaper despite higher rates,35% higher rate but 30% faster,Total cost often lower
Fixed-price contracts reduce budget risk,±10% certainty,$30k budget won't become $45k
18-month breakeven for native iOS is typical,Industry standard,"Not unusual, plan accordingly"
PWA has 6-month breakeven,3x faster than native,Strong case for validation-first approach
36-month ROI ranges from 26% to 1100%,Scenario dependent,PWA and Hybrid offer best returns
